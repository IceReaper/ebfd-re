Emperor: Battle for Dune - File format reverse engineering

The main goal of this project is to provide the logic to parse the game assets for Emperor: Battle for Dune.
This is helpful for modding tool development, modding the game itself or developing a remake.

The current state of the project is:
- Audio: Mostly working, but compressed files have a continuous noise.
- Maps: Unimplemented
- Missions: Unimplemented
- Fonts: Unimplemented
- Models: Mostly working. The VertexAnimation part is unfinished.
